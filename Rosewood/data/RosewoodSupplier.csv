Chinese Customs registered more logs than any other  mber product category origina ng from Laos in 2014 (more than 50,000 m3 RWE, valued at over US$120 million, nearly double the volume and value registered the previous year; see Box 3 for comparable Vietnamese Customs data), and in 2013, 86 percent (by volume; 95 percent by value) of total unprocessed  mber exports, bound largely for Vietnam and China, were reportedly composed of valuable hongmu species whose harves ng was illegal and undocumented.",Asia

Both are classi ed as �reserve� species, meaning any harves ng and trading must be speci cally permi ed by the Ministry of Environmental Conserva on and Forestry (MOECAF).

Despite the ban on Siamese rosewood logging and the roundwood log export ban imposed in 2002, the trade in high- value hongmu species, par cularly Siamese rosewood, is prolifera ng, dominated by select  mber �barons.� These actors also enjoy access to seizures of illegally cut rosewood, as they are o en the  rst to gain access to auc ons, where illegally sourced wood is then e ec vely laundered into the legal supply (EIA 2014a; Global Witness 2015).
